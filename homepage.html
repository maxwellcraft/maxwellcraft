<h1> Max Craft: Systems and Information Engineer </h1>

<br>

<p> 	So what is Systems Engineering?  If you asked five people in my major, you would probably get five different answers.  The University of Virginia prides itself on the wide range of careers that Systems Engineers can go into after graduating from the program.  We gain exposure to projects in computer science, statistical analysis, finance, business, marketing, and managerial practices.  In each field we aim to improve productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency of the systems that we are analyzing.  More than defining a concrete algorithm to follow to generate systems solutions, students in this program have a systems methodology ingrained in us to understand systems problems more holistically, and consider the implications of every decision made beyond just the bottom line.  For me, the prospect of generating valuable business conclusions concurrent with a deep understanding of the sociotechnical implications of a recommendation by applying this methodology  to growing fields such as big data analytics, marketing effectiveness studies, and process optimization is exciting.
