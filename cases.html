<h2> "Presentations on System Evaluation Case Based Coursework" </h2>

<br><br>

<p> These cases represent presentations to clients/professors based on generally one week of analysis for a case using real world data.  Examples include a case involving evaluating the
marketing plan of a major bank, the best moves to make in baseball free agency based on previous statistics about players, managing a call center to increase revenue and efficiency, and
evaluating housing alternatives based on requirements given to us by a student at the University of Virginia.  Backend analysis for these assignments includes the statistical methods that
we covered in this course, applied probability, and applied statistics to run probabilistic models, optimization models, and multifactor analyses.</p>
